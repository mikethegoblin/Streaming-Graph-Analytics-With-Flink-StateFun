 **Proposed Solution.** 
_What is the basic approach, method, idea or tool that’s being suggested to solve the problem? Try to be as specific as possible and mention concrete tools / programming languages / frameworks. Try to reason why these tools are suitable to solve the problem at hand._

**Tech stacks (subject to change)**<br />
Use Apache Flink Stateful Function to handle queries and graph operations (Java)<br />
Docker (decide later if we need to use Docker)<br />
Kafka for event ingress and egress (decide later)<br />
**Basic approach**<br />
 i.  We will implement a statefun application consisting of several stateful functions that perform specific tasks (graph updates or temporal queries) based on incoming events.<br />
**For first half of the project, we’ll focus on:<br />**
data ingestion (include graph updates)<br />
Architecture<br />
**For the second half of the project, we’ll focus on the temporal queries.<br />**
