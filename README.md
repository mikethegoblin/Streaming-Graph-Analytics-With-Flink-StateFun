# How weekly meeting will work
In each meeting (Monday 9pm), a group member will be appointed as a leader (on a rotation basis). The meeting leader will have the following responsibilities:
- set up the zoom meeting
- take notes for the meeting
- lead the meeting (go through the agendas of the meeting)

The purpose of this structure is so that each person will be kept in loop of what is going on and the leadership role won't be subjected to only one person but shared among the team. Furthermore, in each weekly meeting, each person will give the team a small update on their task.

The rotation of the meeting leader is:
- Touch
- Qilin
- Mike
- Ardarsh
- Aaron
