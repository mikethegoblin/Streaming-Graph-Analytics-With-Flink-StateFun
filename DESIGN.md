# 3) Expectations

The expected effect of the proposed solution is an unbounded/bounded temporal graph processing library that are able to do the following:
- Efficiently maintain state/snapshot of an ever-changing graph
- Able to update unbounded temporal graphs
- Able do temporal graph queries
In conclusion, our solution is a working API library that helps developers to process unbounded temporal graph efficiently by utilizing Flink stateful functions.
The alternative approaches we are considering is implementing library after analyzing other temporal graph processing libraries and focus on one problem/flaw of those libraries and improve upon it.
